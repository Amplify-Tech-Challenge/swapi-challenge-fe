Readme in progress, for (way) more information please see the readme for the backend Express API at https://github.com/brabbuss/swapi-express-gateway/blob/main/README.md

Site is built in the Next.JS framework, leveraging the power of static site generation - that being said, the API backend is hosted on Heroku, which often takes a second to spin up...give it a second when the site first loads.

Given scope of challenge and timeframe, minimal styling was applied and site is not currently fully responsive. 

Deployed Site: swapi-challenge-fe.vercel.app
